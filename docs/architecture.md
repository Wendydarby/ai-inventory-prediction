# Project Architecture

## Overview

This document outlines the high-level architecture of the AI-Powered Inventory Prediction System, including key modules and data flow.

## Modules

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and transforms raw sales and inventory data.
- **Forecasting Engine**: Provides demand forecasting using an ensemble of ML models.
- **Inventory Optimizer**: Computes optimal stock levels, reorder points, and categorizes inventory.
- **Visualization**: Builds dashboards and interactive plots.
- **Monitoring**: Tracks prediction accuracy and generates alerts.

## Data Flow

1. Data is loaded and cleaned.
2. Features are engineered for modeling.
3. Models are trained and predictions are made.
4. Inventory decisions are optimized based on predictions.
5. Results are visualized and monitored.
