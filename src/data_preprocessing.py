Data Preprocessing Module

Handles data cleaning, feature engineering, and preparation for ML models.

Functions:
    - load_data: Load historical sales and inventory data
    - clean_data: Handle missing values and outliers
    - create_features: Generate time-based features and indicators
    - normalize_data: Scale features for ML models
